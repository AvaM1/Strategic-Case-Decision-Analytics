# Strategic Case Decision Analytics
# Fire Department Scheduling Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on solving a workforce scheduling problem for a fictional fire department, **Big Town Fire**, using project management and quantitative analysis techniques. Our objective was to create an optimal weekly schedule for firefighters that meets operational requirements while minimizing total labor costs.

The project was completed as part of a course on project scheduling and control, with a focus on real-world application of the **Critical Path Method (CPM)**, **time-based budgeting**, and **project crashing** concepts.

## 💡 Problem Statement
The HR Manager of Big Town Fire tasked our team with designing an efficient employee schedule that:
- Covers all required morning and night shifts throughout the week
- Minimizes costs by balancing full-time and part-time employees
- Avoids understaffing and excessive overtime
- Fulfills public safety obligations with adequate personnel

---

## 📈 Key Objectives
- Translate scheduling requirements into decision variables and constraints
- Build a cost model based on hourly wages and benefits
- Use Excel Solver to minimize total cost while satisfying shift demands
- Explore cost-saving strategies through part-time hires and limited overtime
- Evaluate the cost impact of changes in workforce structure

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Excel Solver** for linear programming
- **Critical Path Method (CPM)** for project duration evaluation
- **Project Crashing** for schedule compression
- Data visualization and performance benchmarking
- Scenario analysis with varying constraints

---

## 📊 Results
- The benchmark solution required 61 full-time firefighters at a cost of **$127,999.20**.
- Introducing 30% part-time employees reduced costs to **$117,180.00**.
- Excessive overtime led to increased expenses, proving part-time staffing as the most cost-effective solution.
- Our model offered scheduling flexibility while preserving service quality and controlling budget overages.
